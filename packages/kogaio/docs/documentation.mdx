  Both the documentation and the structure of [Kogaio][1] are [atomic design][2] based; i.e. the purpose is to encourage, implicitly with examples, the substance of breaking the layout down into its basic components, which are then reused throughout the app.

  Kogaio provides an inbuilt, assertive and extensible [style guide][6], along with a continuously growing set of primitives and examples of their usage.
  It aims for sturdy design implementation, while soothing developers' front end development experience.

  There are a few indispensable libraries that act as dependencies for Kogaio; their purposes vary, from _documentation_ to _extensibility_ to _usability and painless development of responsive design systems_.
